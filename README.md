# COVID19HofstedeCulturalDimensions

The goal of this project was to determine whether there is a correlation between cultural factors and COVID-19 outcomes for different countries. I used disease data from the start of the outbreak until April 8th. To measure cultural differences I decided to use Hofstede's cultural dimensions. I found the cultural dimensions for each country in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zivMjUT7tleuIA-hGn96PG5J7sm2jdGF).
